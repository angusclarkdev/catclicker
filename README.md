## Cat Clicker
This is a simple (and silly) application that served its purpose as a training wheel for learning the fundamentals of React.js. It prompts the user to click on an image of a cat, of which there are four. the application then counts the number of times a user has clicked and renders the result in the DOM. If a new cat is selected, the counter resets to 0.

### Things learned:
* The difference between functional and class components
* Why/When/How state is used to re-render components in the DOM
* Why/When/How/ props are passed from parent components to child
* Unidirectional data flow
* Webpack/Babel 
* JSX syntax
